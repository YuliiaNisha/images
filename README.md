## Description

Online Bookstore API is a **RESTful application** that provides the essential features of an online bookstore:  
- Browsing and searching for books  
- Managing categories  
- Placing orders  
- User registration and login  

Its strength lies in its **simplicity and efficiency**: the project is lightweight, easy to understand, and at the same time offers the **core functionality of a real-world e-commerce application**.

This project employs:  
- **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Spring Security** to simplify development and reduce boilerplate code while maintaining full functionality and security.  
- **Swagger** to provide clear and user-friendly API documentation.  
- **MapStruct** to simplify mapping between entities and DTOs.

## Controllers

Controllers provide functionality to manage:  
- Books  
- Categories  
- Orders  
- Shopping cart  

Additionally, the **AuthenticationController** handles user registration and login.

All endpoints can be divided into three groups:  
1. **Publicly accessible** (AuthenticationController)  
2. **Accessible only to users with the ADMIN role**  
3. **Accessible only to users with the USER role**

## Setup & Usage

### Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.  
2. Copy `.env.sample` into your `.env` file.  
3. Fill in the required credentials (database URL, username, password, etc.).

## Challenges & Solutions

### Restricting Access to Endpoints
#### Challenge: 
Certain endpoints needed to be accessible only to users with role ADMIN
#### Solution: 
Integrated Spring Security with JWT tokens and role-based access.

### Entity-to-DTO Mapping
#### Challenge: 
Default MapStruct mapping methods were insufficient for converting some entities to DTOs and back.
#### Solution: 
Implemented custom mapping methods.
