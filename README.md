## Description
Online Bookstore API is a RESTful application that provides the essential features of an online bookstore:  
- Browsing and searching for books  
- Managing categories  
- Placing orders  
- User registration and login  

Its strength lies in its **simplicity and efficiency**: the project is lightweight, easy to understand, and at the same time offers the **core functionality of a real-world e-commerce application**.
---

## Technologies & Tools
This project employs:  
- **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Spring Security** to simplify development and reduce boilerplate code while maintaining full functionality and security.  
- **MapStruct** to simplify mapping between entities and DTOs.  
- **Swagger** to provide clear and user-friendly API documentation.  
---

## Controllers
Controllers provide functionality to manage:  
- Books  
- Categories  
- Orders  
- Shopping cart  

Additionally, the **AuthenticationController** handles user registration and login.

All endpoints can be divided into three groups:  
1. **Publicly accessible** (AuthenticationController)  
2. Accessible only to users with the **ADMIN role**  
3. Accessible only to users with the **USER role**

| üåê PUBLIC Endpoints | üîí ADMIN Role Endpoints | üë§ USER Role Endpoints |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Register         | Create Book          | Get Book By ID      |
| Login            | Update Book          | Get All Books       |
|                  | Delete Book          | Search for Books    |

|                  | Update Category      | Get Category By ID  |
|                  | Delete Category      | Get Books By Category ID |
|                  | Update Order Status  | Create Order        |
|                  |                      | Get All Orders      |
|                  |                      | Get Order Items By Order ID |
|                  |                      | Get Order Item By ID |
|                  |                      | Get Shopping Cart |
|                  |                      | Add Book To Cart |
|                  |                      | Update Book Quantity in Cart |
|                  |                      | Delete Book From Cart |

## Postman  
A Postman collection is available to simplify testing the API.  
üëâ [Open Online Bookstore Postman Collection](https://postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~49ed7a22-2d52-45ef-8ca1-c68f46105379/collection/40367151-d5b4ff87-5102-4633-b53f-afb2a9a5b27e?action=share&creator=40367151)  

How to use this Postman collection:  
1. Click the link above.  
2. Import the collection into your Postman app.  
3. Run requests against http://localhost:8080/api   
4. Authenticate by registering and/or logging in to get a JWT token.
5. Go to the **Authorization** tab.
6. Choose **Bearer Token** as the Auth Type.
7. Paste the JWT token you received into the token field to access all protected endpoints.

  - Copy `.env.sample` into your `.env` file.  
  - Fill in the required credentials (database URL, username, password, etc.).

4. Build the project
```bash
mvn clean package
```
5. Run the application
   
6. Open Swagger UI in your browser: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

## Challenges & Solutions

### Restricting Access to Endpoints
#### Challenge: 
Certain endpoints needed to be accessible only to users with role ADMIN
#### Solution: 
Integrated Spring Security with JWT tokens and role-based access.

### Entity-to-DTO Mapping
#### Challenge: 
Default MapStruct mapping methods were insufficient for converting some entities to DTOs and back.
#### Solution: 
Implemented custom mapping methods.
